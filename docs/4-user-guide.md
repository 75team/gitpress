## Quick Start

### Did the project https://github.com/<%= user %>/<%= repo %> exists?

**If it did not exists,** create it —— https://github.com/new

**If it did exists** make sure you have [README.md](https://github.com/<%= user %>/<%= repo%>/blob/master/README.md)

**If you have README.md on your project** check if you have [gitpress.json](https://github.com/<%= user %>/<%= repo%>/blob/master/gitpress.json)

The example of gitpress.json is 

```
{
    "docs"      : ["README.md", "docs"],        
}
```

If all done & still has error, please [contact us](http://gitpress.org/~README.md).
